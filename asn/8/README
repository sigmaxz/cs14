DESCRIPTION
-----------

Implement Dijkstra's algorithm in the file Dijkstra.h.

USAGE
-----

1. Extract the files onto an empty directory, and implement Dijkstra's
   Dijkstra's algorithm inside Dijkstra.h.

2. Compile the code by typing make in the terminal; this will use the Makefile
   provided to compile and link your code with necessary libraries.

3. Run tests individually by typing a.out and the test number.
   For example,
     $ a.out 1
   executes test #1 (the $ is the terminal prompt). When you run it like this,
   the result of the run is in result.txt. If the test passed, the test number
   is printed to result.txt, otherwise a 0 is printed.
