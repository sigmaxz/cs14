DESCRIPTION
Use these files with your implementation MyString.cpp to test your code.
You can use your MyString.h file, but you will need to copy all the lines
that "friend" my test classes as you will see in the MyString.h file
provided here.

USAGE
Compile the code and simply execute the program. The program will write the
results to results.txt. If a test passed, the test number will be written to
results.txt, otherwise a 0 will be written. If your code seg faults or
crashes, you can select which test case to run very easily from the main().
All the if statements have an assignment inside, e.g., if(test = 1), which
will set test to 1 and will cause the condition to evaluate to true. If you
want to disable certain tests, write if(test == 1) instead and set the test
variable to the desired value.
