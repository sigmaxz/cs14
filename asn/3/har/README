DESCRIPTION
-----------

Use the included files in conjunction with your files:

SortedList.h
SortedList.cpp
SortedArrayList.cpp
SortedLinkedList.cpp

USAGE
-----

1. Extract the files into an empty directory, and include your files.

2. Compile the code by typing make in the terminal; this will use the Makefile
   provided to compile and link your code with necessary libraries.

3. Execute the test script by typing ./grade in the terminal. The grading
   script will execute all test cases, one by one, and output the results
   to a file named <your current working directory>.txt. There are 29 tests
   total (the test nummbers are not consecutive). Some will take longer than
   others. The total running time of the testing script is just under 20
   minutes. This means that you cannot run it from well or bass because the
   servers will kill any process running longer than 5 minutes. You need to
   run it from a lab machine.

   You can also run tests individually by typing a.out and the test number.
   For example,
     $ a.out 1
   executes test #1 (the $ is the terminal prompt). When you run it like this,
   the result of the run is in result.txt. If the test passed, the test number
   is printed to result.txt, otherwise a 0 is printed.
