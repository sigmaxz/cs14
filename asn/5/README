DESCRIPTION
-----------

Use the included files in conjunction with your files:

AvlTree.h
AlvTree.cpp

USAGE
-----

1. Extract the files into an empty directory, and include your files.

2. Place the follwing "frined" lines just after the class declaration as shown below.

class AvlTree
{
  friend struct test_tree_t;
  friend struct test_1;
  friend struct test_2_3;
  friend struct test_4;
  friend struct test_5_6;
  friend struct test_7_8;
  friend struct test_9;
  friend struct test_10_15;
  friend struct test_16_20;

public:
...

3. Compile the code by typing make in the terminal; this will use the Makefile
   provided to compile and link your code with necessary libraries.

4. Execute the test script by typing ./grade in the terminal. The grading
   script will execute all test cases, one by one, and output the results
   to a file named <your current working directory>.txt. There are 20 tests
   total. The total running time of the testing script is about 20 seconds.

   You can also run tests individually by typing a.out and the test number.
   For example,
     $ a.out 1
   executes test #1 (the $ is the terminal prompt). When you run it like this,
   the result of the run is in result.txt. If the test passed, the test number
   is printed to result.txt, otherwise a 0 is printed.
